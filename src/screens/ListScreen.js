lists - we usually begin with an array of objects
- we will utilize the FlatList primitive React Native element
- we will pass is two props - data (array of data) and renderItem prop (turns each individual item into an element)
- this is the react native equivalent to mapping array in react on web.
    - FlatList is well optimized specifically for mobile
